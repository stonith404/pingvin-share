## Setup project

Pingvin Share consists of a frontend and a backend.

### Backend

The backend is built with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com) and uses Typescript.

#### Setup

1. Open the `backend` folder
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Push the database schema to the database by running `npx prisma db push`
4. Seed the database with `npx prisma db seed`
5. Start the backend with `npm run dev`

### Frontend

The frontend is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and uses Typescript.

#### Setup

1. Start the backend first
2. Open the `frontend` folder
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the frontend with `npm run dev`

You're all set!

### Testing

At the moment we only have system tests for the backend. To run these tests, run `npm run test:system` in the backend folder.
