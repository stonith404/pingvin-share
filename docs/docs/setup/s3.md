# S3

You are able to add your preferred S3 provider, like AWS, DigitalOcean, Exoscale or Infomaniak. However, if you don't
want to store your files on a S3 bucket, you don't have to. Consider that this feature is `DISABLED` per default.

## Configuration

You can configure your S3 provider and bucket by going to the configuration page in your admin dashboard `/admin/config/s3`.
